THIS IS AN OLD VERSION OF [FRUIT'S MOD](https://github.com/soler91/Anti-Bodyblock) TO WORK ON [MENMA'S TERA](https://menmastera.com/).
I changed almost next to nothing, but pulled an earlier version of the mod from Github history and reuploaded it.
If necessary, I'll maintain this version. Although it's unlikely that it'll need updates.

Below is Fruit's readme unedited:

# Anti-Bodyblock

Tired of being bodyblocked by your party members ?
Well use this thing.

## Usage (enabled by default):
type in chat /8 bb
after everyone is inside the dungeon or whatever, 10/10 instructions no one gonna read.

Barely tested mod.
