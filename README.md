THIS IS AN OLD VERSION OF [FRUIT'S MOD](https://github.com/soler91/Anti-Bodyblock) TO WORK ON [MENMA'S TERA](https://menmastera.com/).
I changed almost next to nothing, but pulled an earlier version of the mod from Github history and reuploaded it.
If necessary, I'll maintain this version. Although it's unlikely that it'll need updates.

Below is Fruit's readme unedited:

# Anti-Bodyblock
